# precisesearch
We all know that there are lots of searching tools on the Internet, and they work just fine. However, they need to be installed in advance and keep indexing in the background to provide what is called 'super fast search' on demand. For those who don't want to search files in an index or just want a simple programme that searches faster than non-indexed explorer search, **precisesearch** is **probably the best** choice.
